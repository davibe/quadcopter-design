The main idea is to create a small and minimal quadcopter, cheap, easy to fly
that can carry a go pro and shoot decent videos.

- Motor to motor (diangonal) distance: 40cm
- Target flight weight: 800g
- Props: 8x45
- Motors: anything comparable to Hacker 20-26m (~40g)
- Flight controller: naze32
- Flight controller software: Baseflight

There are at least 2 ways to carry the gopro avoiding propellers to show up
in the camera FOV (Field Of View). One is to have a 'deadcat' style frame with
a long center plate that holds the gopro in the front of the 4copter. Another
is to have a structure that holds the gopro far below the quadcopter.

The files named longplate* explore the first design. The files named
dadeb-model* explore the second one instead. Other files are drafts or common
parts reused across designs.

For the moment there is no gimbal involved.
